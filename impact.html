<h1><em>
Shyamveer - The story of a Teacher </em> </h1> </center>
<br>

<p>

A little boy accompanied his father to the city in search of work, leaving behind an ailing mother and the rest of his family. Shyamveer was all of seven, and his father was determined that he should not waste his time on the streets, but get an education instead. So he did what he thought was best. He enrolled him in the Mobile Creches centre closest to his place of work. The village boy played truant - he only turned up when the milk and porridge was served, and ran away from studies. But the crèche didis guided him firmly back on path, and coaxed him into a routine.<br>

 

Once the doors of knowledge opened, Shyamveer became greedy for more and soon he was enrolled in Class III in the government school. From the rough and tumble of an aimless life, Shyamveer now lost himself in the world of books and children's magazines. He received the Sohanlal Trust scholarship every year, from Class VI to XII and soon he had graduated from college. Life was not always smooth sailing for the young man. Often, financial constraints weighed him down, but his friends pitched in and saw him through. He remembers this generosity and never fails to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Shyamveer wished to be a chartered accountant but had to take up a job as a teacher in a government school instead, to support his family. The role of a teacher and mentor sit well upon his shoulders. Today he is always there for his students - lending books, encouraging those who lag behind, and helping his neighbours' children.

<em><h1>Sharda- The Delhi Police Personnel</h1> </em></center>
<br>
<p>Sharda is part of the Delhi Police Force. Her life story began as a neglected toddler of an invalid mother and labourer father, third of four siblings. At three years her dreary world looked brighter when she began going to the Rajghat Mobile Creches centre and discovered the little joys of childhood through song, dance and painting. Sharda got admission in the government school at age five and began dividing her day between school in the mornings and the centre in the afternoons, doing her homework and enjoying the security of her surroundings.<br>

In her teens, inspired by the centre activities, Sharda started teaching the women in the basti to read and write. She completed school and learnt other skills such as knitting, crochet and embroidery. The crèche didis were always there for her, helping out and lending a sympathetic ear. Sharda was in the second year of college when her father suddenly passed away. Undeterred she set up a small business in stitching garments. <br>

In a few years Sharda was married. Although she continued earning, her husband and mother-in-law would give her scant respect and take away her earnings. Life got worse as they inflicted physical violence on her. The MC Centre saw her through these difficult times and helped her seek legal advice and complain to the special women's cell. They boosted her confidence by asking her to help out - especially to talk to the mothers on such issues.<br>

Sharda decided she needed to expand the horizons of her narrow world. She completed a one-year Childcare Training and followed it with another year's training in Civil Defense. She was then offered a job with the Delhi Police and decided to take the plunge.
